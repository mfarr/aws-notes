## S3 101

* Simple Storage Service - provides secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage
* Object-based storage - manages data as objects rather than in file systems or data blocks
* Not suitable for OS or DB storage
* Unlimited storage, objects up to 5TB in size (0 bytes to 5 TB)
* S3 Buckets - like a folder/directory. Universal namespace, name must be globally unique
* ``https://{bucket-name}.s3.{region}.amazonaws.com/{key-name}``
* Returns 200 on successful upload via API
* Key-value store - Key, value, version ID, metadata
* Highly available and highly durable
* Tiered storage, lifecycle management, versioning
* Can enable server-side encryption, access control lists (ACLs) with fine-grained control, bucket policies (eg. allow users only certain access)

## S3 Storage Classes

* S3 Standard
	* Suitable for most workloads
	* High availability and durability
	* Stored redundantly across multiple facilities (>= 3 AZs)
	* Designed for frequently accessed data
* S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3-IA)
	* Infrequently accessed critical data
	* Rapid access
	* Pay to access the data, low per-GB storage price and per-GB retrieval fee
	* Great for long-term storage, backups, and DR files. Minimum storage duration: 30 days
* S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
	* Long-lived, infrequently accessed, **non-critical data**
	* Like S3-IA but data is stored redundantly within a single AZ
	* 20% less than S3-IA
	* Minimum storage duration: 30 days
* Glacier
	* Very cheap
	* Optimized for data that is very infrequently accessed
	* Pay each time you access data
	* Use only for archiving data
	* Retrieval range from 1 minute to 12 hours. 90 days minimum storage duration
* Glacier Deep Archive
	* Rarely accessed data (~once per year or never) with default retrieval  time of 12 hours. 180 day minimum storage duration
* S3 Intelligent Tiering
	* 2 tiers - frequent and infrequent access
	* Unknown or unpredictable access patterns
	* Automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective tier based on how frequently each object is accessed
	*  Small added monthly cost

## Securing S3 Buckets

* Secure by default. Buckets are created as private by default only accessible by owner
* Bucket policies - setup access control
	* Applied at bucket level, apply to all objects in the bucket
	* Not fine-grained
	* Useful for groups of files
	* Written in JSON
* Bucket ACLs
	* Applied at the object level rather than bucket level
	* Fine grained control
* Access Logs
	* Not enabled by default
	* Logs all requests made to the bucket

## S3 Encryption

* Encryption in transit
	* SSL/TLS (ie. HTTPS)
* Encryption at rest - Server Side Encryption
	* SSE-S3 - S3 managed keys, using AES-256
	* SSE-KMS - AWS Key Management Service managed keys
	* SSE-C - Consumer provided keys
* Encryption at Rest - Client Side Encryption
	* You encrypt the files before uploading them
* Enforcing SSE
	* Two ways
		* Console - select the encryption setting on the bucket
		* Bucket policy enforce encryption using a bucket policy
* Enforcing at upload time
	* ``x-amz-server-side-encryption`` header
		* ``AES256`` (SSE S3)
		* ``aws:kms`` (SSE KMS)
	* Bucket policy can be used to enforce the requirement of this parameter or require all traffic to be served over SSL/TLS

## Overview of CloudFront

* CDN
* Easy and cost-effective way to distribute content with low latency and high data transfer speeds
* **CloudFront Edge Location** - servers in geographically dispersed locations, keep caches of content
* **CloudFront Origin** - origin of all files that will be served. S3 Bucket, Ec2 Instance, Elastic Load Balancer or Route53
* **CloudFront Distribution** - name given to the Origin and configuration for the content you wish to distribute using CloudFront
* Global network of 200+ edge locations
* Requests automatically routed to the nearest edge location
* Optimized, integrated to work with other AWS services
* Also works with own origin server
* Default TTL is 1 day, clearing prior to TTL costs money
* S3 Transfer Acceleration
	* Uploads to edge location are then transferred to S3 using optimal network path
	* Faster way for remote users to upload

## CloudFront Allowed Methods

* When creating, need to specify HTTP methods that distribution will support
* 3 options to choose from - two are read-only, one is read/write
